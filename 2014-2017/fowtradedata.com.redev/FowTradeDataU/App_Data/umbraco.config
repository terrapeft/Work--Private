        <content><![CDATA[<h3>Resolving Symbols and Enabling Choice</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How good symbol management and interoperability promote competition in buy and sell side services.</strong></p>
<p>The choice of and the investment in trading solutions for both the buy side and sell side of the derivatives industry is an important determinant in the degree to which competition exists in brokerage and other trading related services.   Well managed instrument symbology enables sell side firms to offer trading, risk management, clearing and settlement services to the buy side, irrespective of the product choice that a buy side client has made.  The innovation of commercial services for symbol mapping has enabled sell side firms to gain competitive advantage to win new business that may have otherwise been inaccessible to them, to reduce internal costs and to comply with vendor data licensing conditions.   For buy side firms, the choice of sell side services has increased as a direct result of consistent symbology mapping of otherwise unique vendor identifiers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Industry Problem with Symbology</strong></p>
<p>Symbol management of financial instruments is not a new subject yet it has never been more exposed in the press and media as pivotal to regulatory compliance,  Many firms still carry out vendor instrument mapping internally within so-called black operations, potentially breaching vendor data licensing restrictions unwillingly, but out of necessity.  This has been driven by the lack of truly global identifiers that would be acceptable in commercial, regulatory and operational terms.  Embedded trading solutions and invested operations technology mean that developments toward a common standard are more likely, under free market forces, to be incremental than those mandated by unilateral industry change.</p>
<p>Sell side services that require translation of incoming client positions need to validate the price executed through the client trading platform, either using the buy side’s original trading product symbols or by using an alternative sell side source(s) or both. Carrying incorrect symbology can lead to trade mismatches and mispricing of open positions with inherent asset risk, compliance risk, settlement exposure and reputational impact.  Where a sell side firm does not carry a vendor’s instrument symbols, the buy side faces reduced competitive offerings to only those sell side providers who can support that buy side’s choice of vendor product.</p>
<p>In cases where official industry identifiers are not available many firms generate their own internal version of a constructed symbol in order to complete the trade order process leading to unique instances of what should be common symbology.  Without regular database auditing against subsequent official identifier allocations, firms become increasingly burdened by manual intervention to resolve incorrect contract mappings in risk management or compliance reporting functions in other parts of the firm.</p>
<p>Problems can also arise in the timeliness of available symbols for new contract listings as vendors and other industry bodies can take different approaches as to when new symbols are allocated.  Forward dated contracts may carry a pre-allocated symbol or the symbol may be dynamically allocated once the contract is openly tradable or has been traded for the first time, although industry investment means that is now easier to allocate and publish new symbols more effectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Xymbology Service</strong></p>
<p>The Xymbology service is offered by Euromoney TRADEDATA, an independent provider of quality reference data for exchange-traded futures and options.  The Xymbology database carries over 15 distinct symbologies in a collaborative approach with market data and independent software vendors, regulatory and other industry bodies and offers a whole universe of tradable contracts against which participants’ symbols are cross-referenced.  The clean order match of a traded series product to the correct listed instrument can fundamentally underpin a superior position management environment.</p>
<p>Enriched data feeds allow the import of portfolio transactions from client originated platforms to be instantly mapped into clearing and settlement systems, all referencing the correct exchange traded instrument.  Open positions can then be dynamically tracked for clients by utilising the same or alternative vendor equivalent traded series symbology to retrieve real-time prices from market data sources and client reports enriched with additional attribute information. </p>
<p>The strength of the Xymbology service is that Euromoney TRADEDATA’s independent and neutral industry status encourages multi-vendor participation in this niche area to provide effective solutions to mutual clients’ needs.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.428571429;"><br />Resolving Symbols</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">The existence of robust symbology maintenance to allow trade data to be passed between mixed vendor products is an essential component in the complex and component based architecture of modern trading operations.   In this respect Xymbology is a game changer that has altered competition dynamics in both the sell side and buy side in the listed futures and options market. </span></p>
<p>For the buy side the selection of trading products is no longer limited to those products that sell side brokers could readily support due to cross-referencing gaps in unique vendor instrument symbols.   Limited choice in broker services has been replaced by increased service offerings from more brokers that can translate incoming identifiers from buy side firms.  This opens up the prospect of increased broker service choice for the buy side, new accessible business for the sell side and for trading product providers, the real prospect of switch sales from incumbents. </p>
<p>New client on-boarding times can be reduced and thereafter, persistent quality of service for clients is underpinned by effective operational processes based on robust instrument mapping across all vendor and proprietary components used.  In addition the application of cross-vendor symbology mapping improves middle office risk management and for the back office increases efficiency in straight through processing in clearing and settlement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Enabling Choice</strong></p>
<p>The innovation of Xymbology as a commercially available instrument cross-reference database of key vendor participants in the futures and options space has brought significant benefits to the industry.  Since its introduction the service has resulted in an increase in both choice and competition in services offered to the buy side community and has enabled sell side firms to improve the quality of service to their clients through an unrestricted choice of vendor platform.</p>
<p>Brokerage service firms can offer seamless implementation of new clients, with invested operations of differing configured technologies for market data and order execution.  This capability can provide a competitive advantage in winning new business, more often than not in a switch sale, with minimum disruption and high quality of service.</p>
<p>With risk management and regulatory compliance reporting at the top of many senior managers’ agendas, good symbology can also reduce risk and help avoid large fines from lodging of incorrect transaction records. </p>
<p><br /><strong>Open Symbology</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">The uneven playing field caused by unique symbology has been levelled to a more open environment, where future product choice can be made on best functional merit as the focus of competition and not symbology.   The Xymbology service:</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">•     Allows product choices for end-users to be open and not restricted by legacy<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">•     Enables product switching to be justified and more easily implemented<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">•     Adds competitive edge to the sell side who can win new business by operating a vendor neutral environment<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">•     Compels vendors to win business on product merit in a more competitive environment<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">•     Delivers sell side improvements to operational efficiency and reduces processing costs<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">•     Raises quality of service offerings and wider choice for the buy side<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">•     Allows ready price retrieval from alternative market data vendors increasing competition<br /></span>•     Assists the industry to achieve lower exception reporting and improved risk management.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"><br /><strong>Notes</strong></span></p>
<p>Xymbology clients include over 10 major tier 1 investment banks, financial institutions, independent software vendors, transaction service providers and regulatory and other industry bodies.  The Xymbology service continues to attract new vendor participants and users who immediately benefit from quality managed symbology.</p>

            This page explains what cookies are, how we use them on the websites of the Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC group and your options for controlling    them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Please note:
        </p>
        <p>Not all the cookies listed here will necessarily be used on each website.</p>
        <p>We will display our cookie prompt once when you visit each of our sites.</p>
        <p>If you send us a request in relation to activity logging on our websites as explained in the table below, this will apply to your use of all our sites so    you only need to make one request.</p>
        <p><b>What are cookies? </b></p>
        <p>Cookies are pieces of information which include a unique reference code that a website transfers to your device to store and sometimes track information    about you. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session (“session cookies”) and expire when you close your browser. Other    cookies are used, for example, to remember you when you return to the site and will last for longer (“persistent cookies”). Cookies cannot be used to run    programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to your device and are sent back to the originating website on each subsequent    visit (if they last longer than a web session) or to another website that recognises that cookie.</p>
        <p>Some of the cookies used by our sites are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services (such as interest based advertising and    web analytics) on our behalf.</p>
        <p><b>What do we use cookies for? </b></p>
        <p>
            Some cookies are essential to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website or areas with    paid-for content. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like shopping baskets, cannot be provided. Because such cookies are essential for    using a site, these cookies cannot be turned off without severely affecting your use of the website.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other cookies perform various functions, as the table below explains, together with your options for controlling them.
        </p>
        <p>Some cookies may also be controlled by using your web browser settings. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change    your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set.</p>
        <p>You can also learn more about cookies in general by visiting    <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank"><b>www.allaboutcookies.org </b></a>which includes additional useful information on    cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser.</p>
        <p>For more general information about online behavioural (interest based) advertising and how it uses cookies, you may wish to visit    <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/"><b>www.youronlinechoices.com</b></a></p>

If you have not logged in and are browsing anonymously, if you subsequently register or are already registered on our web                    site(s), your online actions on our websites may retrospectively be linked to your user details, and therefore ascribed to you. This is                    done using information stored in the Webtrends cookies and captured in pixel files unless you have deleted the Webtrends cookie or                    registered an opt out with Webtrends. This information provides us with a full picture of how our customers interact with our sites to                    better understand their interests in order to tailor our services and products.
